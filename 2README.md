# Refactoring Project

## Description

- Some problems I solved were to make sure all of the id's work and fixing image tag.
- I fixed some of the classes so that it's all on one so it doesn't take up space.
- Another thing I fixed was the Semantic Elements on the page.
- I learned the difference between non-semantic and semantic code.
